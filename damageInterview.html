        Damag3 is a nonbinary rapper from Batton Rouge Luisiana. Over the past year they have grown a following by making kick ass music that calls
        attention to the issues facing the queer community. As a queer white rapper there was quite a few obsiticals they have had to overcome.
        Some of the rap community tries to gatekeep rap, but Damag3 never gave up. They have made it into the scene with a large following of trans
        and queer people. Damag3 credits their buddhist values as well as their close friends for helping them push through all of the obsticals
        in their life. They suggested the podcast Secular Buddhism which is availible on Spotify for those who need a new way of seeing their problems.

        Damag3 is not the only lgbtq+ artist out there. In fact they gave me a list of other artists from our community on the come up. They
        shouted out Figgy Baby, (more here).

      <p>Before wrapping up the interview I asked Damag3 if they had any advice for young trans people in states like Texas or Tennissee. They said
      the most important thing to is to make sure you have support and resources. </p>
